"# HwScript" 

move all the script into the root folder of all the homework

unzip.py - unzip all the zip file
relocatefile.py - move specific files into all the folder
complierAndrun.py - compile all the cpp file and run, the output will be store in the record.txt in the root folder

still some bugs needs to be fixed
